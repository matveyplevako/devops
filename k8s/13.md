To get visit data we need to show content of time.txt file on each pod

 ```shell
$kubectl exec pods/app-python-chart-0 -- cat /app/shared/time.txt
2021-10-04 22:28:35.182802
2021-10-04 22:28:35.493030
2021-10-04 22:28:35.948833
$kubectl exec pods/app-python-chart-1 -- cat /app/shared/visits.txt
2021-10-04 22:28:40.203832
2021-10-04 22:28:40.583933
2021-10-04 22:28:41.899302
$kubectl exec pods/app-python-chart-2 -- cat /app/shared/visits.txt
2021-10-04 22:28:48.294939

1. Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for
replicas.
- Deployment resulted in using the same PVC for all pods, however we need to make them use different for each app.
- with volumeClaimTemplates we create separate volume for each pod

2. For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Describe in the report why. Then find a way to tell to
the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel. Implement it.
- Synchronization between pods is not needed for our app, so we can start apps in parallel with `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"`
